        <p class="text-gray-800 text-lg md:text-xl mb-6 font-light">
          Vocation began in June 2011, fueled by a shared passion for exceptional travel experiences. Our founders, with their dedication to customer service and an intuitive grasp of travel needs, started small – a team of just a few. But by December of that year, Vocation was taking off. Individuals, corporations, even esteemed members of government entrusted us with their travel plans. We quickly established ourselves as experts in crafting dream itineraries – domestic and international flights, seamless visa services, catering to both business and leisure travelers, and meticulously planned hotel packages for both solo adventurers and group getaways.
